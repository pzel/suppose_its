What does it do?
-------------------

`suppose_its` uses a technique called **library interposing** to override calls to the `gettimeofday(2)` system function. It can be used to trick programs into thinking the system time is different from the actual time. The canonical use case is acceptance-testing date-related code. 

It runs on Linux (debian, ubuntu), FreeBSD, and OS X (Leopard and later versions), provided the system has a C compiler and a POSIX-compliant shell (sh, ksh, dash, bash) available at `/bin/sh`.

It will not work with statically compiled programs.


Basic Use
---------------

 Assuming you have placed the `suppose_its` script in your $PATH and it is executable, you can use it as follows:

1. Place a [POSIX timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in a file of your choosing:
        
        $ echo -n "1234567890" > test_timestamp.txt

2. Pass the timestamp location and program command as arguments to `suppose_its`:
        
        $ suppose_its ./test_timestamp 'ghc -e "System.Time.getClockTime"'
        Sat Feb 14 00:31:30 CET 2009
        
        $ suppose_its ./test_timestamp.txt '/usr/bin/ruby -e "puts Time.now.to_i"'
        1234567890
        
        $ rm ./test_timestamp.txt
        $ ./suppose_its ./test_timestamp.txt '/usr/bin/ruby -e "puts Time.now.to_i"'
        1335544057  # Returns the actual system time if the timestamp is not found on disk.


Dynamic Use
---------------

`suppose_its` checks for the timestamp before every call to `gettimeofday(2)`. This means you can effectively "travel through time" while a program is being executed. 

        $ echo -n "1234567890" > test_timestamp.txt
        $ ./suppose_its ./test_timestamp.txt python
        Python 2.7.2+ (default, Oct  4 2011, 20:03:08) 
        
        >>> from datetime import *
        >>> datetime.today()
        datetime.datetime(2009, 2, 14, 0, 31, 30)
        >>> def given_now_is(timestamp):
        ...open('test_timestamp.txt','w').write(str(timestamp))
        ... 
        >>> given_now_is(1294599990)
        >>> datetime.today()
        datetime.datetime(2011, 1, 9, 20, 6, 30)


Bugs and Limitations
--------------------

 * Quotes in arguments for programs run with `suppose_its` need to be escaped. 
   
         $ ./suppose_its ts ghc -e "fmap show System.Time.getClockTime"
         Warning: ignoring unrecognised input `System.Time.getClockTime'
         target `show' is not a module name or a source file
         # No go. 
         
         $ ./suppose_its ts ghc -e \"fmap show System.Time.getClockTime\"
         "Thu Jan  1 01:01:40 CET 1970"
         # That worked.
        
 * Alternatively, the whole command can be single-quoted:
        
        $ ./suppose_its ts 'ghc -e "fmap show System.Time.getClockTime"'
        "Thu Jan  1 01:01:40 CET 1970"

 * Some programs do not use `gettimeofday(2)` to retrieve time data, rendering `suppose_its` useless.

        $ echo -n "100" > test_timestamp.txt
        $ ./suppose_its ./test_timestamp.txt date
        Fri Apr 27 18:41:01 CEST 2012
     
        $ ./suppose_its ./test_timestamp.txt 'csi -e "(use posix) (display (seconds->string (current-seconds))) (newline)"'
        Fri Apr 27 19:02:06 2012


Wanted:
---------------

 * Interposing for the `time(2)` function.
